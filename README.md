# Breakout-ball-game
The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle which can interest the user.
– Tools & technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript and HTML Canvas API to facilitate smooth animations.
– The project aimed to recreate the classic arcade game while incorporating modern design elements and smooth gameplay. There is a paddle at the bottom of the screen that can be controlled using arrow keys or mouse movements and a ball that bounces off the paddle and walls, destroying bricks upon collision.The project demonstrated my ability to create interactive and visually appealing games using these technologies.
